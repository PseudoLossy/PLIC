# PLIC: Pseudo-Lossy Image Compression

**ðŸš§ Repository Under Construction ðŸš§**

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for "Quality-Preserving Extreme Image Compression: Using Interpretable Conditioning Inputs with Diffusion Models", a novel compression framework leveraging diffusion models and conditioning inputs to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining strong perceptual similarity and superior image quality.

## Abstract

Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, but their potential for image compression remains underexplored. We introduce PLIC (Pseudo-Lossy Image Compression), a compression framework leveraging diffusion models and conditioning inputs to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining strong perceptual similarity and superior image quality. Unlike traditional neural compressors using abstract latent representations, our approach uses interpretable conditioning inputs (text prompts, canny edges, color palettes) to guide diffusion-based image reconstruction. 

Grounded in rate-distortion-perception theory, PLIC prioritizes minimizing bitrate and distortions over pixel-perfect reconstruction, allowing diffusion models to fill in plausible details during decompression which still results in high perceptual similarity. Evaluating on 490 real-world images scraped from top 1,000 globally visited domains, we demonstrate superior compression ratios (0.004 bits per pixel minimum, 0.197 bits per pixel average) while maintaining excellent image quality (mean BRISQUE=23.36, mean CPBD=0.60) and high perceptual similarity across diverse content types including text, faces, and logos.

## Method Overview

PLIC leverages three key conditioning inputs for compression:

- **Text Prompts**: CLIP/GPT-generated descriptions capturing semantic content
- **Canny Edges**: Structural boundary information preserving object shapes  
- **Color Palettes**: Dominant color information from downscaled representations
- **Saliency Masks** (optional): Focus regions for enhanced preservation

The framework uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 as the base model, with ControlNet conditioning to guide reconstruction from these interpretable inputs rather than abstract latent codes.
